List of functions and brief description: 

* [__unorm__](https://github.com/gerber211/mjglib/blob/main/unorm.m) - Normalizes a vector or matrix to \[0,1\] for all elements
* [__figp__](https://github.com/gerber211/mjglib/blob/main/figp.m)  - Plots a vector in a new figure window as red dots
* [__stats__](https://github.com/gerber211/mjglib/blob/main/stats.m) - Output summary statistics of a matrix or vector 
* [__circshift_columns__](https://github.com/gerber211/mjglib/blob/main/circshift_columns.m) - Circularly shift each column of a matrix by an amount specified in a vector; adopted and modified from Stuart Layton's code [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37687-circular-shift-columns)
* [__bwclearborder__](https://github.com/gerber211/mjglib/blob/main/bwclearborder.m) - Clear true pixels touching the border of a binary image; This does the same thing as IMCLEARBORDER in Matlab, but is much faster and works only on binary images
